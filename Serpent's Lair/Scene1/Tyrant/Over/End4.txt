You travel through an oppressive, cloud-covered darkness, your paltry torch the only guide  to your plodding steps. Strange shapes loom from the side of the road: trees, mostly, but some might perhaps be structures? Or wandering wolves? It is difficult to say, but you have your own concerns. Daybreak brings heavy mist, but no sign of an end to your long, arduous journey.

You have reached the fourth ending.
